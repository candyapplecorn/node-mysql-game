The game is simple: be top-doge.
Buy attackers and attack other rows; when a row's morale hits 0 it's destroyed.
Attackers cost money; more money generators accrue money faster, and likewise for fuel and fuel generators.

The "source" input is either the row which is paying for a purchase, sending resources and troops, or making an attack.
The "target" input is either the row which to be purchased, accept a transfer, or be attacked.

An attack is strengthened by a row's attacker level.
A row's defense is strengthened by its defense level.
Attackers defend their row, so buy many!
Wounded attackers recover from the hospital at a rate which can be increased by increasing a row's hospital level.
