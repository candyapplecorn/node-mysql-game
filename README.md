# php-mysql-game
This repository contains a developer's guild project.
This is a web game. 
The user interface will be in HTML, while the logic of the game will be in PHP and SQL (MySQL specifically). 
The idea is to send user requests to the server using AJAX or POST or whatever, have PHP handle those requests and query the database, and then send a response back to the user.
The project is designed to run on a linux server.
